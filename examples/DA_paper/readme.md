#  Modeling Chemical Processes in Explicit Solvents with Machine Learning Potential

This folder includes codes and starting files for various computational tasks related to the paper "Modeling Chemical Processes in Explicit Solvents with Machine Learning Potentials" (https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64a8085fba3e99daefab8f89). These tasks include training implicit and explicit potentials, calculating 2D potential energy surfaces, 1D free energy surfaces, uphill dynamics, and downhill dynamics. 

Please note that due to the large size of the training and validation data, as well as the uphill and downhill trajectories, these data are not included in the GitHub repository. To obtain access to these data, kindly contact the authors via email.

One aim achieved in the paper is to train an machine learning potential for the Diels-Alder reaction of CP and MVK in the explicit solvent. Here we illustrated the workflow of training such potentials as following:
