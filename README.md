# mlp-train
General machine learnt potential (MLP) training for molecular systems

***
### Install

```
./install.sh
```

Machine learning potentials can be installed directly from [scripts/](scripts).

### Notes

- Units are: distance (Å), energy (eV), force (eV Å-1), time (fs)
- Training using molecular mechanics (MM) is not supported as we've not found it to be efficient
