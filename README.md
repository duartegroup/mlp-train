# mlp-train
General machine learning potentials (MLP) training for molecular systems in gas phase and solution

Available models:
- GAP
- ACE
- MACE


***
### Install

Each model is installed into individual conda environment:

```
# Install GAP
./install_gap.sh

# Install ACE
./install_ace.sh

#Install MACE
./install_mace.sh 
```


### Notes

- Units are: distance (Å), energy (eV), force (eV Å$`^{-1}`$), time (fs)
